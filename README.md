### 9.js
    You are provided with two numbers. Find and print the smaller number.

### 10.js
    Let "A"  be a string. Remove all the whitespaces and find it's length.

### 11.js
    Let "A" be a year, write a program to check whether this year is a leap year or not.
    Print "Y" if its a leap year and "N" if its a common year.
    
### 12.js
    The area of an equilateral triangle is ¼(√3a2) where "a" represents a side of the triangle. You are provided with the side "a". Find the area of the equilateral triangle.
    
### 13.js
    You are given the coefficients of a quadratic equation in order A, B & C.
    Where A is the coefficient of X2,  B is the coefficient of X and C is the constant term in the most simplified form.
    Example: For  X2 + 5X + 6 = 0, you are given the input as: 1 5 6.
    Write a program to find all of the roots of the quadratic.
    Note: The output should be up to 2nd decimal place (round off if needed) and in case of a recurring decimal use braces i.e. for eg: 0.33333..... => 0.33.
    Note: Use Shri Dharacharya's Method to solve i.e. X = {-b + √(b² - 4ac) } / 2a & {-b-√(b² -4ac)} / 2a
    
### 14.js
    You are given with a number "N", find its cube.
   
### 15.js
    Using the method of looping, write a program to print the table of 9 till N in the format as follows:
    (N is input by the user)
    9 18 27...
    Print NULL if 0 is input
    
### 16.js
    You are given three numbers A, B & C. Print the largest amongst these three numbers.
    
### 17.js
    You are provided with a number "N", Find the Nth term of the series: 1, 4, 9, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, .......
    (Print "Error" if N = negative value and 0 if N = 0).
    
### 18.js
    You are given A = Length of a rectangle & B = breadth of a rectangle. Find its area “C”.
    (A and B are natural numbers)
    
### 19.js
    You are given with a number A i.e. the temperature in Celcius. Write a program to convert this into Fahrenheit. 
    Note: In case of decimal values, round-off to two decimal places.
